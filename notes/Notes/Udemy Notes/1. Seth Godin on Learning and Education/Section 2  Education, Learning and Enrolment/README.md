## Education vs. Learnin


**Education demands passive compliance while learning requires active participation.**


> 💡 Distinguish between the trade of education and the practice of learning.

> Education requires conformity and coercion. Learning exists independently of organized systems. Students trade years of life for scarce paper certificates. Action produces skill. **___Seth Godin**

## The Education Trade


### Why this matters

- Education relies on a **transaction: compliance for a degree.**
- Institutions use coercion to ensure attendance.
- Systems prioritize the **test over knowledge retention.**

## The Failure of Passive Consumption


### Why this matters

- **Information access** **does not equal skill acquisition.**
- Entertainment creates an **illusion of progress.**
- Lectures provide convenience but **rarely facilitate mastery.**

## Learning Through Action


### The Chef Principle


**Watching a chef yields no cooking ability.** 


**Breaking eggs** and **making omelets** builds expertise. Learning happens during the work.


## The Purpose of School


### Why this matters

- **Traditional schools** focus on indoctrination for paper.
- **Future systems** must focus on **two goals:** <u>solving interesting problems and leading.</u>
- **The internet ends information scarcity.**

## Future Accreditation


### Why this matters

- **Digital platforms** allow individualized instruction.
- Accreditation will shift from institutional prestige to human skill.
- <u>Value moves from holding a degree to proving a capability.</u>

<summary>Answer to Question 3 :</summary>

I am practicing coding and keeping all my projects on github, I am keeping all my notes and all my plans organized in notion, These are only few parts which proves my being good. There are many people who have good CGPA but do not know one thing at all. They just focused on Getting good marks in the exam but did not do the practice. On the other hand, I can prove myself by showing the number of projects and the quality of them to the employers.
