> 💡 Authentic learning replaces compliance with enrolment and practical projects.


**A Pedagogy of Enrolment** **: Learning for the sake of learning.**


**Traditional education** focuses on compliance and coercion. 


Conforming to requirements serves the test.

> Knowledge disappears after testing concludes.

## The Compliance Model


### Why this matters

- Compliance ensures **conformity across large groups.**
- Standardized testing provides **speed but lacks depth.**
- Extrinsic motivation **fails to produce permanent mastery.**

## The Enrollment Alternative


### Why this matters

- Enrollment connects learning to specific personal goals.
- **Voluntary commitment fuels long-term retention.**
- Interest-driven education yields faster results.

## Information vs. Absorption


### Why this matters

- Modern tools provide **infinite data.**
- Access to experts no longer requires physical proximity.
- **Authentic learning** requires internalizing concepts through action

### MY ANSWERS

<summary>Answer to Question 1 :</summary>

It was one time at my school, taking classes with Sir Shahen Shah the long legendary chemistry teacher there for us, He suddenly asked me about a topic I knew very well, but I had forgotten its name and that was as easy as a cup of tea. But i remember the words of one of my best teachers i ever had Sir Zaheer Abbas, “What you learn easily, you forget that easily”. It was me who was so god blessed genius, Everything I look into was no more than duck soup. But I forgot some of them that propmptly as I had learnt.

<summary>Answer to Question 2 :</summary>

I learnt English Language so good, I was aware that all the students who know English will learn each and every subject that easy as the Courses were all in English Language. It helped me in science and all the learning I could do online not keeping myself confined to the handy resources like my teachers and textbooks.

<summary>Answer to Question 3 :</summary>

I am currently enrolled in BS Computer Science in an affiliated college with the University of Peshawar. The study their is not that good nor do the teachers know themselves what they teach. If I had to say I would have covered the whole syllabus by now, but I did not made my mind and was not looking forward to achieving good marks and CGPA. Therefore, being good enough to score 4 out 4, I did not give a thought of doing so. On the other hand I love learning and I am Learning from books, I want to learn about the people and minds, I enjoy learning that.
