## MY ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 1 :</summary>

In my life, the family members matter the most to me. My father passed away while I was a kid of 10 to 11. Since, then my brothers have supported me in all ways possible and have always let me do what I liked, that is why They matter the most to me for their love and affection.

<summary>Answer to Question 2 :</summary>

If I am true I have always been so supportive irrespective of my advantage, I always helped each and every person I knew especially my friends as I am so God blessed since childhood. I have helped my friends in making things work for them and have provided support to them and always provided my most heartly suggestion that I knew will help them. 
The other people that rely on me are my youngers my nephews, I provide them support and show them the way to go. These members are entrusted to me by my brothers who once supported me and are doing so now too.

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 3 :</summary>

This can be answered in many ways, as it depends on the way of life or method one follows. Specifically I have been inspired from many : 


In Political Personalities it has always been **Imran Khan,** He has provided the the foundation to the youth and has taught the reality about the politicians and military doing wrongs. He has proved that the country is down due to the corruption unlike other countries.


If it is religious, then **Molana Tariq Jameel** is the one. He has always made the youth know what other Molanas kept to themselves. Other would show the wrath of the Almighty Allah, but he would make you love Allah and has always explained the Rehm of Allah and the repentence acceptance to him.


Let us talk about the teachers of mine, the cleanliness POV has been developed by **Sir Jamal Shah.** The decision making especially to treat youngers always goes to **Sir Saleem.** If it comes to the attentiveness and keeping attractive personality is the one and only Chemistry King **Sir Shahen Shan.** The truthfulness which is one of my biggest traits has great hand of **Sir Awais** behind me. He would forgive anything unless untruthfulness. The managerial roles and affection to students especially poor ones come from **Sir Waheed.** The leaders play the most important role, which I have learnt from **Sir Arbab Shahab and Sir Riasat Ali** the principals of my school and the college.


The family members that inspire me the most are no other than the one who left everything for the family to support **Muhammad Ismail,** the backbone and the why we exist in this good lifestyle. And, **Muhammad Mahmood,** Who is educated but had  an eye for business from long ago. He is climbing the heights touching the sky. Looking at him gives me hope and confidence to reach him and join him in his vision helping all the other brothers and sisters as we two are the youngest of all.

<summary>Answer to Question 4 :</summary>

I think always about the betterment of the society and the people around me. I feel I live with the people who do not think even a little.

I have always had good grades, good image of my own, but it is no more motivation but anxiety to keep myself in the race and conquer not to remain behind. This is making me work day and night not only focusing my studies but researching the true life by reading books and listening to those who did things in their lives. The peoples regrets and happiness the same guides me to the light.

<summary>Answer to Question 7 :</summary>

I have always kept myself the best version for others or I will say I tried. Not for the purpose to be remembered but I feel the way it is when someone does bad to you or other things that make people sad and sorrow.
