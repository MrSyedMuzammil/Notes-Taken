## MY ANSWERS TO THE QUESTIONS

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 1 :</summary>

In my life, the family members matter the most to me. My father passed away while I was a kid of 10 to 11. Since, then my brothers have supported me in all ways possible and have always let me do what I liked, that is why They matter the most to me for their love and affection.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 2 :</summary>

If I am true I have always been so supportive irrespective of my advantage, I always helped each and every person I knew especially my friends as I am so God blessed since childhood. I have helped my friends in making things work for them and have provided support to them and always provided my most heartly suggestion that I knew will help them. 
The other people that rely on me are my youngers my nephews, I provide them support and show them the way to go. These members are entrusted to me by my brothers who once supported me and are doing so now too.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 3 :</summary>

This can be answered in many ways, as it depends on the way of life or method one follows. Specifically I have been inspired from many : 


In Political Personalities it has always been **Imran Khan,** He has provided the the foundation to the youth and has taught the reality about the politicians and military doing wrongs. He has proved that the country is down due to the corruption unlike other countries.


If it is religious, then **Molana Tariq Jameel** is the one. He has always made the youth know what other Molanas kept to themselves. Other would show the wrath of the Almighty Allah, but he would make you love Allah and has always explained the Rehm of Allah and the repentence acceptance to him.


Let us talk about the teachers of mine, the cleanliness POV has been developed by **Sir Jamal Shah.** The decision making especially to treat youngers always goes to **Sir Saleem.** If it comes to the attentiveness and keeping attractive personality is the one and only Chemistry King **Sir Shahen Shan.** The truthfulness which is one of my biggest traits has great hand of **Sir Awais** behind me. He would forgive anything unless untruthfulness. The managerial roles and affection to students especially poor ones come from **Sir Waheed.** The leaders play the most important role, which I have learnt from **Sir Arbab Shahab and Sir Riasat Ali** the principals of my school and the college.


The family members that inspire me the most are no other than the one who left everything for the family to support **Muhammad Ismail,** the backbone and the why we exist in this good lifestyle. And, **Muhammad Mahmood,** Who is educated but had  an eye for business from long ago. He is climbing the heights touching the sky. Looking at him gives me hope and confidence to reach him and join him in his vision helping all the other brothers and sisters as we two are the youngest of all.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 4 :</summary>

I think always about the betterment of the society and the people around me. I feel I live with the people who do not think even a little. They do what they want not thinking of the people around them, It’s greed everwhere,  envy and jealousy. This has driven me long time. Since I am the student of BS Computer Science, Now I have started thinking about making impact and finding good place and good people to work with.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 5 :</summary>

I am so greatful for having my brothers as they have always supported me in every where and place in my life. I am so greatful no thing can measure.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 6 :</summary>

I have always had good grades, good image of my own, but it is no more motivation but anxiety to keep myself in the race and conquer not to remain behind. This is making me work day and night not only focusing my studies but researching the true life by reading books and listening to those who did things in their lives. The peoples regrets and happiness the same guides me to the light.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 7 :</summary>

I have always kept myself the best version for others or I will say I tried. Not for the purpose to be remembered but I feel the way it is when someone does bad to you or other things that make people sad and sorrow.

1. Identify one topic you learned for a test and promptly forgot.
2. Share a time when you learned a skill faster because you cared about the outcome.
3. How would you describe your current enrollment in your projects?

### MY ANSWERS

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 1 :</summary>

It was one time at my school, taking classes with Sir Shahen Shah the long legendary chemistry teacher there for us, He suddenly asked me about a topic I knew very well, but I had forgotten its name and that was as easy as a cup of tea. But i remember the words of one of my best teachers i ever had Sir Zaheer Abbas, “What you learn easily, you forget that easily”. It was me who was so god blessed genius, Everything I look into was no more than duck soup. But I forgot some of them that propmptly as I had learnt.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 2 :</summary>

I learnt English Language so good, I was aware that all the students who know English will learn each and every subject that easy as the Courses were all in English Language. It helped me in science and all the learning I could do online not keeping myself confined to the handy resources like my teachers and textbooks.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 3 :</summary>

I am currently enrolled in BS Computer Science in an affiliated college with the University of Peshawar. The study their is not that good nor do the teachers know themselves what they teach. If I had to say I would have covered the whole syllabus by now, but I did not made my mind and was not looking forward to achieving good marks and CGPA. Therefore, being good enough to score 4 out 4, I did not give a thought of doing so. On the other hand I love learning and I am Learning from books, I want to learn about the people and minds, I enjoy learning that.

## Section 2 : Education, Learning and Enrolment

## Education vs. Learnin


**Education demands passive compliance while learning requires active participation.**


> 💡 Distinguish between the trade of education and the practice of learning.

> Education requires conformity and coercion. Learning exists independently of organized systems. Students trade years of life for scarce paper certificates. Action produces skill. **___Seth Godin**

## The Education Trade


### Why this matters

- Education relies on a **transaction: compliance for a degree.**
- Institutions use coercion to ensure attendance.
- Systems prioritize the **test over knowledge retention.**

## The Failure of Passive Consumption


### Why this matters

- **Information access** **does not equal skill acquisition.**
- Entertainment creates an **illusion of progress.**
- Lectures provide convenience but **rarely facilitate mastery.**

## Learning Through Action


### The Chef Principle


**Watching a chef yields no cooking ability.** 


**Breaking eggs** and **making omelets** builds expertise. Learning happens during the work.


## The Purpose of School


### Why this matters

- **Traditional schools** focus on indoctrination for paper.
- **Future systems** must focus on **two goals:** <u>solving interesting problems and leading.</u>
- **The internet ends information scarcity.**

## Future Accreditation


### Why this matters

- **Digital platforms** allow individualized instruction.
- Accreditation will shift from institutional prestige to human skill.
- <u>Value moves from holding a degree to proving a capability.</u>

<summary>Answer to Question 1 :</summary>

Swimming is one thing I learnt by jumping into the pool, My friends were telling me exact steps i thought it would be easy but it was not the same even a bit.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 2 :</summary>

Front End Web Development is the one thing i learnt by doing, Although it was in our syllabus but we were not taught well. Online slides were there just to be scrolled by the Professor. Not a bit was there i learnt at College, Only I taught it myself.

On the other hand, I can prove myself by showing the number of projects and the quality of them to the employers.
