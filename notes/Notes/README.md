1. Identify one topic you learned for a test and promptly forgot.
2. Share a time when you learned a skill faster because you cared about the outcome.
3. How would you describe your current enrollment in your projects?

### MY ANSWERS

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 1 :</summary>

It was one time at my school, taking classes with Sir Shahen Shah the long legendary chemistry teacher there for us, He suddenly asked me about a topic I knew very well, but I had forgotten its name and that was as easy as a cup of tea. But i remember the words of one of my best teachers i ever had Sir Zaheer Abbas, “What you learn easily, you forget that easily”. It was me who was so god blessed genius, Everything I look into was no more than duck soup. But I forgot some of them that propmptly as I had learnt.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 2 :</summary>

I learnt English Language so good, I was aware that all the students who know English will learn each and every subject that easy as the Courses were all in English Language. It helped me in science and all the learning I could do online not keeping myself confined to the handy resources like my teachers and textbooks.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 3 :</summary>

I am currently enrolled in BS Computer Science in an affiliated college with the University of Peshawar. The study their is not that good nor do the teachers know themselves what they teach. If I had to say I would have covered the whole syllabus by now, but I did not made my mind and was not looking forward to achieving good marks and CGPA. Therefore, being good enough to score 4 out 4, I did not give a thought of doing so. On the other hand I love learning and I am Learning from books, I want to learn about the people and minds, I enjoy learning that.

## Section 2 : Education, Learning and Enrolment

## Education vs. Learnin


**Education demands passive compliance while learning requires active participation.**


> 💡 Distinguish between the trade of education and the practice of learning.

> Education requires conformity and coercion. Learning exists independently of organized systems. Students trade years of life for scarce paper certificates. Action produces skill. **___Seth Godin**

## The Education Trade


### Why this matters

- Education relies on a **transaction: compliance for a degree.**
- Institutions use coercion to ensure attendance.
- Systems prioritize the **test over knowledge retention.**

## The Failure of Passive Consumption


### Why this matters

- **Information access** **does not equal skill acquisition.**
- Entertainment creates an **illusion of progress.**
- Lectures provide convenience but **rarely facilitate mastery.**

## Learning Through Action


### The Chef Principle


**Watching a chef yields no cooking ability.** 


**Breaking eggs** and **making omelets** builds expertise. Learning happens during the work.


## The Purpose of School


### Why this matters

- **Traditional schools** focus on indoctrination for paper.
- **Future systems** must focus on **two goals:** <u>solving interesting problems and leading.</u>
- **The internet ends information scarcity.**

## Future Accreditation


### Why this matters

- **Digital platforms** allow individualized instruction.
- Accreditation will shift from institutional prestige to human skill.
- <u>Value moves from holding a degree to proving a capability.</u>

## MY ANSWERS

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 1 :</summary>

Swimming is one thing I learnt by jumping into the pool, My friends were telling me exact steps i thought it would be easy but it was not the same even a bit.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 2 :</summary>

Front End Web Development is the one thing i learnt by doing, Although it was in our syllabus but we were not taught well. Online slides were there just to be scrolled by the Professor. Not a bit was there i learnt at College, Only I taught it myself.


</details>

<details>
<summary>Answer to Question 3 :</summary>

I am practicing coding and keeping all my projects on github, I am keeping all my notes and all my plans organized in notion, These are only few parts which proves my being good. There are many people who have good CGPA but do not know one thing at all. They just focused on Getting good marks in the exam but did not do the practice. On the other hand, I can prove myself by showing the number of projects and the quality of them to the employers.
